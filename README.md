# Industrial-Demo
An industrial demo with sample analytics ( Forklift )

---

## 🚀 Features:

* Short simulation for a Forklift used in industries
* Meta XR integration
* Unit tests to check the utilities module
* Tested with Meta Simulator ( although the OVRCamera position might be imperfect )
* Sequential instructions with analytics ( only time and module details )

## ⚙️ Instructions in-game:

* Start the simulator
* Follow the on-screen instructions and finish the simulation
* Proceed to view the generated analytics at `/StreamingAssets/ForkLiftAnalyticsData.json`

## 🧱 Build instructions:

* Open the project in Unity 3D ( version : 2022.3.16f1 )
* Go to `File/Build Settings`
* Proceed to build the project by clicking on 'Build'

## 📝Notes:

Working on this project has been a really fun experience! I have tried my best to replicate a fraction of the work that I have done so far and hope this is able to represent that. The entire project was tested in the Meta simulator in Unity and hence the OVR rig might not be positioned properly ( needs proper syncing with the headset on ). Please also view a short demo of the project in the link below as well.
